  <div class="main-content">
    <p>Women put a lot of time and effort into how we present
    ourselves. Whether it’s to maintain personal standards,
    professional mentality, social appearance, or simply just to be
    a female, there are many frustrations and expectations we
    put upon ourselves to achieve a level of “put-together-ness”.</p>

    <p>As a woman, I know the frustrations and indecisiveness of
    choosing the perfect outfit, shoes, lipstick, handbag, and more
    specifically, a nail color to act as the final accessory. As
    someone who frequents nail salons once a month, I knew my
    same frustrations were similar to the girl’s standing next to
    me in front of the ‘giant wall of color’, unsure which color
    would complete our “look.”</p>

    <p>In order to get to the root of my observed problem, I chose to
    create a much leaner problem statement and conduct
    research to support my hypothesis that women have a hard
    time selecting a nail color from a large assortment of colors.</p>
